## ⚙️ ThingsBoard Setup (Full Reproduction)

### 1️⃣ Import Rule Chains (IMPORTANT ORDER)

Import rule chains in the following order:


1. **Wokwi Rule Chains**  
   ```
   - soil_moisture_rule.json  
   - fire_detection_rule.json  
   - water_quality_rule.json
   ```
2. **Dataset Rule Chains**  
   ```
   - dataset_soil_moisture_rule.json
   - dataset_fire_detection_rule.json
   - dataset_water_quality_rule.json
   ```

3. **Root Rule Chain**  
   ```
   root-rule-chain.json
   ```

Ensure the **Root Rule Chain** is connected to all child rule chains.

---

### 2️⃣ Import Device Profiles
1. Go to **Profiles → Device Profiles**
2. Click **Import**
3. Upload:
   ```
   thingsboard/device-profiles/default.json
   ```

---

### 3️⃣ Device Creation (Manual Step)

ThingsBoard does **not support exporting devices**, therefore devices must be created manually.

### Required Device Names (EXACT)

#### Dataset Devices
- Dataset Soil Moisture Device  
- Dataset Fire Detection Device  
- Dataset Water Quality Device  

#### Live Wokwi Devices
- Soil Moisture Device  
- Fire Detection Device

   thingsboard/dashboard/iot_based_technologies_for_precision_agriculture_and_environmental_monitoring.json
   ```

---

## 🔑 Device Credentials (MQTT)

For each device:
1. Open the device in ThingsBoard
2. Go to **Credentials**
3. Copy the **Access Token**

---

## 🧪 Wokwi Code Configuration

Edit the relevant `.ino` file:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID "Wokwi-GUEST"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD ""

#define THINGSBOARD_SERVER "<YOUR_THINGSBOARD_HOST>"
#define TOKEN "<DEVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

Files:
- wokwi/soil-moisture/Soil Moisture with thingsboard.ino

- wokwi/water-quality/water quality with thingsboard.ino

Click **▶ Play** in Wokwi to start telemetry transmission.

---

## 📊 Dataset-Based Simulation

CSV datasets are stored in:
```
data/datasets/
```

These datasets are processed using ThingsBoard rule chains for analysis and visualization.

### Python Scripts for Dataset Management

Two Python scripts are provided to manage and upload historical data:

#### 1️⃣ Update Timestamps (`update_timestamps.py`)

This script updates CSV timestamps to match your desired date range and intervals.

**Usage:**
```bash
python update_timestamps.py
```

**Configuration:**
```python
# Irrigation System (60-second intervals)
update_csv_timestamps(
    input_file="irrigation_dataset.csv",
    output_file="irrigation_2026_60s.csv",
    start_date="2026-01-27 12:40:00",
    interval_seconds=60
)

# Fire Detection (30-second intervals)
update_csv_timestamps(
    input_file="fire_detection_dataset.csv",
    output_file="fire_detection_2026_30s.csv",
    start_date="2026-01-27 12:40:00",
    interval_seconds=30
)

# Water Quality (45-second intervals)
update_csv_timestamps(
    input_file="water_quality_dataset.csv",
    output_file="water_quality_2026_45s.csv",
    start_date="2026-01-27 12:40:00",
    interval_seconds=45
)
```

**Required Python packages:**
```bash
pip install pandas
```

---

#### 2️⃣ Upload to ThingsBoard (`upload_to_thingsboard.py`)

This script uploads CSV data to ThingsBoard devices via REST API.

**Usage:**
```bash
python upload_to_thingsboard.py
```

**Interactive Menu:**
```
1. Irrigation System
2. Fire Detection
3. Water Quality
4. ALL THREE (one after another)
0. Exit
```

**Configuration:**
```python
# ThingsBoard Server
THINGSBOARD_HOST = "demo.thingsboard.io"

# Device Tokens (from ThingsBoard device credentials)
IRRIGATION_TOKEN = "YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN"
FIRE_TOKEN = "YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN"
WATER_QUALITY_TOKEN = "YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN"

# CSV Files
IRRIGATION_CSV = "irrigation_2026_60s.csv"
FIRE_CSV = "fire_detection_2026_30s.csv"
WATER_QUALITY_CSV = "water_quality_2026_45s.csv"

# Upload delay between rows
UPLOAD_DELAY = 0.5  # seconds
```

**Required Python packages:**
```bash
pip install pandas requests
```

**Features:**
- Progress tracking during upload
- Error handling and retry logic
- Upload statistics (success/fail counts)
- Configurable delay between uploads
- Historical timestamp preservation

---

### Dataset Upload Workflow

1. **Prepare datasets** with original timestamps
2. **Run `update_timestamps.py`** to adjust dates and intervals
3. **Configure device tokens** in `upload_to_thingsboard.py`
4. **Run `upload_to_thingsboard.py`** and select dataset(s)
5. **Monitor progress** in console output
6. **Verify data** in ThingsBoard dashboard

- Check serial monitor for connection errors
- Verify device token matches ThingsBoard credentials

### Dashboard Shows No Data
- Confirm device is online in ThingsBoard
- Check device credentials are correctly configured
- Wait 30-60 seconds for first data transmission

### Python Script Upload Fails
- Verify device tokens are correct
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure CSV files exist in correct directory
